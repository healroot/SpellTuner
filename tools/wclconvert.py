Turns a raw fight downloaded by tools/wclfetch.py into a SpellTuner recording --
the same stream Engine/FightRecorder.lua writes -- so that somebody else's raid
replays through our own engine with no engine changes.

What is MEASURED from the log (and how):
  maxHP      least squares of absolute HP change (damage - healing) against the
             reported HP percentage; the residual is carried into the record
  mana       the healer's own mana at every one of their casts (classResources)
  cost       the cast's own mana cost, as the client reported it
  regen      least squares over the mana curve: what is left after the costs.
             This absorbs Innervate, potions, Mana Spring and Judgement of
             Wisdom into one observed rate, which is what `energize` means.
  known      family -> highest rank they actually cast
  crit       their realised heal crit rate over the fight
What is INFERRED and marked as such:
  role       the player who took the most damage is the tank; our healer is the
             healer; everybody else is a damager
  healing    the spellPower the client reported on their own casts, x
             SPELLPOWER_TO_HEALING -- the log's field is SPELL DAMAGE, not +healing

T111: the healer may be a priest, shaman or paladin (the log's own class);
the profile carries that class and its inferred talents, and --observed writes
the per-rank observed table tools/wclcheckkit.lua --fit reads (Chain Heal: the
cast's own target only). A druid is converted exactly as before.
