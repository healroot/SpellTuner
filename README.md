# SpellTuner

*Formerly ManaDemon. Your saved settings and recordings carry over; `/md` still works beside `/st`.*

Mana management for TBC Anniversary healers: a live **time-to-OOM** projection, a
**healing rank dashboard** for downranking decisions, and push alerts at the moments
that actually matter (Innervate/potion timing, "your efficient rank changed — rebind?",
drink reminders).

## Features

- **`OOM 1:20 v  rest 2:10`** — one-line clock, as a floating widget and/or an ElvUI
  datatext. The label carries the sign: `OOM 1:20` while you are draining, `FULL 0:45`
  while regen wins (and out of combat, drinking included). `rest 2:10` is how long until
  full if you stop casting right now. `OOM >4:00` means the net rate is within noise;
  `~` marks an unstable read; `vv` in red under 20s. Digits are shown only as precisely
  as the model actually knows them. The thin underline fills over 5s after each cast —
  full means spirit regen is running (five-second rule).
- **`SpellTuner Regen`** — a second ElvUI datatext showing your *current* mp5 (casting
  regen inside the five-second rule, full regen outside), unlike the stock one.
- **`/md`** — rank dashboard: spell tabs, every rank with heal / mana / HPM / HPS and
  **To OOM** (how many times you can chain-cast it from your current mana, counting
  casting regen) using *your* +healing, talents, Tree of Life form and TBC downranking
  penalties; Lifebloom shows x2 / x3 rolling-stack rows. A **Simulate** row lets you
  override +healing, crit, mp5 and mana to see what a gear change would do. Druid-only for
  now; everything else works for any mana healer.
- **`/md options`** — settings window (Cell-style tabs): widget lock / rest segment /
  position, alerts, spend half-life, minimap button, and the **Debug Console** — a
  filterable log of regen, mana ticks, casts and the clock's state, with a Copy popup.
- **Advisor** — "Innervate now — you're down 4,200 mana", "Super Mana Potion now",
  "+52 healing — Regrowth R7 is now your efficient rank. Rebind?", "Drink."
- **End-of-combat line** — `3:42 | net -212 mp5 | spent 18.4k | overheal 31% |
  spirit regen realized 64% | max-rank casts 71%`.

## Commands

`/md` dashboard · `/md options` · `/md unlock` / `lock` / `reset` widget · `/md mute` ·
`/md drink` · `/md rest` · `/md window N` · `/md verify` · `/md fsrtest` ·
`/md regentest [N]` · `/md debug` · `/md help`

## Building

`make release` asks which checkout to build (main or a git worktree) and writes
`dist/<name>/SpellTuner/` plus a zip at the repo top level; `make release SRC=main` skips the
prompt; `make install WOW_ADDONS="/path/to/Interface/AddOns"` also copies it into the game.

## First install

The widget appears unlocked for 60 seconds — drag it where you want it, then `/md lock`.
Run `/md verify` once: it checks the static TBC spell data against your client and prints
anything that needs fixing. `/md regentest` (idle, partial mana, no drink, 30s) tells
whether your client's mana regen value includes Dreamstate. Both land in the Debug
Console (`/md debug`, enable logging, Copy).

ElvUI users: enable the **SpellTuner** datatext in any datatext slot
(ElvUI config → DataTexts).
