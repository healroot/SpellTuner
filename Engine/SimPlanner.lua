-- Plans: a healing strategy a human could actually follow, and the machinery to
-- score one, compare it with what the player did, and say what to change.
--
-- CAUSALITY: Plan:Decide(state, t) receives, and may read, ONLY: t; each
-- target's hp, maxHP, alive, and the player's own HoT state on it as of t;
-- mana, form, cooldowns as of t; and ONE derived input: each target's damage
-- taken over the trailing 5 s, computed from events already applied -- and,
-- for the solver, each target's danger line as of t (SM.DangerLine: the biggest
-- hit already applied; S.danger / tg.danger is the whole fight's and is the
-- SCORE's, never read by a plan) -- and, for the solver's price of the regen a
-- cast forfeits (SV.Forfeit, 2026-09-29), the healer's own present regen state:
-- S.fsrUntil (the five-second rule's end as of t), S.regenBase and
-- S.regenCasting (GetManaRegen's two rates), S.energize (the measured leftover
-- the client omits) and S.manaMax (UnitPowerMax). None of them says anything
-- about the fight after t. It holds
-- no reference to the scenario's event arrays and nothing it schedules may
-- depend on any event with t' > t. A cast, once started, is locked until it
-- lands. This is what makes the card advice rather than hindsight.
--
-- The author, 2026-09-07: "be aware that a human cannot see the future like the
-- simulation does. A human can only guess by aggro, AoE or a target spell
-- indication, plus the tank is usually the one taking damage." That is exactly
-- the budget above: the trailing 5 s is the guess, and "the tank takes damage"
-- is `Anchor`, which picks the TANK role and falls back to whoever has taken
-- the most. tools/replaycheck.lua PINS this rather than trusting the comment: a
-- burst of damage arriving at 40 s must not change a single cast the plan makes
-- before it.
--
-- A plan is deliberately small: at most five bound spells and five rules in a
-- fixed order. "Cast rank 7 here and rank 9 there" is not a strategy a person
-- can execute at 2am in a heroic, and a suggestion nobody can follow is worse
-- than no suggestion.

-- THE RUN (docs/SPEC-v0.9.md 5): the same coordinate descent, one plan for the
-- whole dungeon, scored on a chain of pulls with the gaps in between.
--
-- The score is v0.7's tuple with TIME put in front of mana:
--   (deaths, floorSeconds, addedTime, drinks, manaUsed, -heldOn, #binds, overheal)
-- 2026-09-29: manaUsed is the RUN's -- mana at the first pull less mana after the
-- last, gaps, drinks and potions included -- where it was the pulls' gross
-- spend. SM.ChainRun carries each pull's five-second rule into the gap after
-- it, so the regen a late cast forfeits is charged there, once.
-- `addedTime` is the time the run got LONGER because a drink did not fit its
-- gap; `drinks` is next because each is most of a minute of five people standing
-- still even when it does fit. Mana ranks after both: in a dungeon mana is only
-- worth the time it saves (docs/DECISIONS.md v0.9).
