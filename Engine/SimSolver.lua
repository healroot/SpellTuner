-- The solver (docs/SPEC-v0.13.md).
--
-- A spell is a series of DEPOSITS: {dt, amount}. A direct heal is one deposit at
-- the end of the cast, a HoT is one per tick, Lifebloom is its ticks plus the
-- bloom, Swiftmend is one deposit now that removes the remaining deposits of the
-- HoT it eats. Nothing else about a spell reaches the decision.
--
-- The amounts come from RankMath:SpellKit(), which is to say from THE USER'S OWN
-- STATS. The same code run by a level 64 druid in Hellfire and a level 70 druid
-- in Sunwell schedules differently because their deposits differ. There is no
-- table of health thresholds to re-tune per character; that was the point.
--
-- Against the deposits stands the DEMAND: health missing now, plus health the
-- forecast says will go missing. THE FORECAST MAY READ ONLY WHAT A HUMAN CAN SEE
-- (docs/SPEC-v0.12.md §2) -- the present, the trailing damage, threat, and an
-- enemy cast already in the air. Scheduling against the damage that actually
-- arrives would make this clairvoyant and its advice unreproducible.
--
-- Every candidate is scored by projecting the target twice, with the cast and
-- without it, and measuring the missing-health integral it removes per mana:
--
--     saved = gap(without) - gap(with)          value = saved / mana
--
-- That one number carries all three things asked of it. Health gap: it is the
-- integral. Overheal: a deposit landing above full buys no reduction, so it
-- scores itself down with no penalty term. Mana: it is per mana. And the timing
-- falls out -- a deposit landing late reduces the gap less than the same deposit
-- landing now, so a deeply hurt target pulls a direct heal and spread damage
-- pulls a HoT, with no rule saying so.

-- hp0 now, damage at `rate` a second, an inbound lump, plus two deposit lists

--
-- v0.13.5, the author: "we prefer top up people health, minimal overheal is
-- good, but underheal is bad. also new death is unacceptable."
--
-- A flat integral cannot say that. A target parked at 95% for a hundred seconds
-- and one at 50% for ten score the same area, and the second is the one who dies
-- to the next hit. So each missing point is weighted by how much of the bar is
-- already gone:
--
--     weight = 1 + bias * (missing / maxHP)
--
-- At bias 2 a target at half health counts twice per missing point against one
-- that is nearly full, and topping somebody up beats shaving the last 5% off
-- somebody who is fine. Overheal needs no term of its own and still gets none: a
-- deposit above full buys no reduction, which is "minimal overheal is good"
-- without pretending it is as bad as leaving somebody low.
--
-- Deaths are not priced here at all. They are the first element of the
-- lexicographic tuple and no amount of mana or health-seconds trades for one.

-- 3b. The price: a cast's mana PLUS the regen it forfeits (2026-09-29)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The author, after a practice fight at level 10: "I've found the coach issue,
-- it does not tolerate non casting window to regen. It will be less relevant on
-- higher level, but as a concept it is critical." (docs/DECISIONS.md, "The coach
-- values regen".)
--
-- A cast restarts the five-second rule, and inside the rule the pool refills
-- at the casting rate rather than the base rate. On Forever that is 11.5 mana a
-- second against 0.001: a Healing Touch R2 (55 mana) cast out of the rule
-- forfeits 57.5 more. Pricing a cast at its cost alone made every lapse of the
-- rule worthless, so the solver never let one happen.
--
-- The price is the difference between two mana curves over the cast's own
-- window [t, land + 5]: without the cast, and with it. The two are the same
-- until the cast lands (mana leaves at success), so
--
--   forfeit = max(0, min(R * added, room - G1))
--
--   R      base - casting rate: what a second inside the rule costs
--   added  the seconds of [land, land + 5] the rule would NOT have covered
--          anyway -- 5 out of the rule, 5 - r with r seconds of it left, 0
--          when it already runs past land + 5 (a cast inside a running rule
--          is cheap and one out of it is dear, which is how bursts and rests
--          fall out of one price with no rule saying so)
--   room   what the pool has left when the cast lands, without it: regen that
--          would only overflow a full pool is worth nothing
--   G1     what both branches regain in [land, land + 5] at the in-rule rate
--          (casting + energize); only what the pool could hold beyond that is lost
--
-- At a full pool the forfeit is 0 and the price is the cost; with R = 0 (TBC's
-- Innervate, or a class whose rates agree) it is exactly the cost, and the
-- solver decides exactly as it did before this change.
--
-- Everything read is present tense and the healer's own: S.fsrUntil (the 5SR
-- underline), S.regenBase / S.regenCasting / S.energize (GetManaRegen and the
-- measured leftover), S.manaMax (UnitPowerMax). Nothing about the fight's future.
-- The danger rule (8) does NOT use it: safety is priced at the nominal cost.
