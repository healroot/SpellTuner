-- A RUN: one dungeon, start to finish, instead of one pull (docs/SPEC-v0.9.md
-- §3). A boss fight is a pull; five-man content is thirty pulls and the gaps
-- between them, and the gaps are where the mana goes -- the drinking, the
-- corpse runs, the mana you were carrying when the next pack came. None of
-- that exists in a single fight's stream, so none of it could be coached on.
--
-- What this file owns: the container. Every pull recorded while a run is
-- active is handed here by Engine/FightRecorder.lua INSTEAD of the ring of 8
-- (a run is pinnable as a whole), including the pulls under the recording gate
-- -- they are what a dungeon is made of, and they are marked `short` so the
-- Review tab can grey them out rather than coach from them. Between pulls this
-- file records mana every 2s, the drink buff with the mana either side of it
-- (so the run measures its OWN drink rate; there is no preset), deaths and the
-- time spent dead, zone changes, Innervates and potions.
--
-- Runs are MANUAL: /md run start, /md run stop. Auto-start on entering an
-- instance is reserved -- Start() takes a reason and db.runAutoStart ships
-- false, so it is one `if` away when the author asks for it.
--
-- Nothing here is modelled. v0.9.3 chains the pulls through the engine and
-- scores the run; this file only writes down what happened.
