-- Simulation engine (docs/SPEC-v0.7.md 3). One event-driven loop over one
-- scenario, driven either by a recorded script (replay) or by a plan that
-- decides what to cast (v0.7.4). It is the only place healing, mana and time
-- are advanced, so a replayed fight and a hypothetical plan are scored by
-- exactly the same code -- which is the whole point: a suggestion the engine
-- cannot reproduce on the real fight is not a suggestion, it is a guess.
--
-- The rank math never runs inside the loop. RankMath:SpellKit() flattens every
-- known rank into plain numbers once, per form, before Run() starts.
--
-- "Zero allocation" means the LOOP allocates nothing: the heap, the per-target
-- scratch and the result arrays all come from a reused pool slot, and the
-- recorded timelines are read by index and never copied. Run itself still
-- builds its handful of local closures once per call -- a few hundred bytes,
-- which the self-test's 4 KB budget covers -- because the alternative is a
-- flat function soup nobody can check by reading. The result and every array
-- on it belong to the slot: read them before the next Run.
--
-- Two conventions worth stating because they are NOT arbitrary:
--
--  * Mana leaves, and the five-second rule restarts, when a cast SUCCEEDS, not
--    when it starts. That is what the client does and what the logs show
--    (.logs/dungeon-BF-1.txt: "[mana] -460" and "[spend] Regrowth cost 460"
--    carry the same timestamp as "5SR start"). docs/SPEC-v0.7.md 3.6 wrote
--    "at cast start"; the log wins. A plan is still charged at the moment the
--    cast lands, so it can never spend mana it would not have had.
--  * Regen is integrated continuously rather than in 2s ticks. Over a 40s pull
--    that is worth at most one tick of phase error (~1% of a 7k pool) and it
--    removes an arbitrary tick alignment the engine has no way to know.

--
-- A pull's score answers "did the healer hold the group up for this mana". A
-- run's answers "how long did the dungeon take, and how much of that was
-- standing still drinking", which is the question mana actually decides in
-- five-man content. That is only answerable if the gaps are in the simulation:
-- a plan that spends 20% less does not bank the mana, it skips a drink.
--
-- What is the healer's, and therefore simulated: the plan (per pull) and the

-- therefore fixed: the damage, the other healers, the deaths of others, how
-- long each gap was, and the drink rate -- measured on this run, never a preset
-- (docs/DECISIONS.md v0.9).

-- excess (`addedTime`), which is the term the run score ranks above mana.
