-- Static TBC druid healing spell data. Costs are read LIVE from the client
-- (GetSpellPowerCost works on the 2.5.x anniversary client: /md verify
-- checked 44 costs on 2026-09-03) and this table is the fallback plus the
-- reference the verify harness diffs against. Heal values, cast times and
-- coefficients still come from here.
--
-- Costs corrected from /md verify output on 2026-09-03 (level 64 druid):
-- Rejuvenation R6-R12, Tranquility R1-R4, Swiftmend. Fields marked VERIFY
-- are the least certain (heal values for ranks not yet learned).
--
-- v0.14.7: the heal values were CHECKED against 17 level 70 Warcraft Logs
-- parses, and they hold. Solving each parse for the +healing that makes this
-- table reproduce what the log says each spell healed, four independent
-- families -- a Rejuvenation tick, a Regrowth tick, a Lifebloom tick and its
-- bloom -- agree on one number per parse to within a few percent
-- (tools/run.sh tools/wclcheckkit.lua --fit). The 1.6-1.8x error that was
-- blamed on this table was the IMPORTER reading the log's spellPower as
-- +healing; nothing here was wrong. Healing Touch R12/R13 stay marked: nobody
-- in the corpus casts one, so nobody has measured them.
