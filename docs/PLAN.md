# ManaDemon — plan (from 2026-09-03)

Two phases. Phase 1 finishes and hardens the druid experience on the author's own
character, where everything can be measured. Phase 2 opens the dashboard to other
classes, where testing is harder (no alts), so it is built on verified generic parts.

Status legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[?]` needs in-game data.

**Design for everything below in §1b/§1c/§1d: `docs/DESIGN-v0.5.md`** (architecture,
formulas, UI mockups, delivery order v0.5.0–v0.5.5). **All of §1b, §1c and §1d shipped in
v0.5.0–v0.5.4**; the calls made along the way are recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §v0.5.
What remains in Phase 1 is §1a: the author's in-game logs (`docs/TESTING.md` §5, §8, §9,
§10), which confirm three model assumptions and tune the clock's constants.

## Phase 1 — druid, verify and improve

### 1a. Close the open verification items (cheap, needs the author in-game)
- [x] **Tree of Life aura on heals** — confirmed: +25% Spirit acts as +healing on the
  target (dynamic, HoTs already running gain it). Model unchanged.
- [x] **Empowered Rejuvenation on the Lifebloom bloom** — confirmed yes; applied.
  Lifebloom coefficients 0.5187 / 0.3422 confirmed exact.
- [x] **Relic slot** — author confirmed the idol; `SD.relics` reads slot 18. Other idols
  still VERIFY as they get equipped.
- [?] **Heal values for unlearned ranks** (`-- VERIFY` in `Data/SpellData.lua`): read the
  spellbook tooltips as ranks are learned (65–70); freeze the table.
- [x] **Heal-side percent stacking** (Gift of Nature + Improved Rejuvenation): with the
  relic confirmed the data fits multiplicative (1.265). Kept.
- [?] **Clock constants** `K_SIGMA` / `CV_STABLE` (`Engine/TTO.lua`): one logged real
  fight (`TESTING.md` §5). Judge: was the shown OOM time honest, jumpy, pessimistic?

### 1b. Model improvements (already justified)
- [x] **Nature's Grace** as an expected-value cast-time term — shipped in v0.5.1 as the
  exact mixture `(1−p)·T0 + p·max(T0−0.5, 1.5)` (the floored form clips the wrong branch
  at the GCD); grey `*` in the Cast column, derivation in the row tooltip. The 0.5s is
  [?] until the new `cast` debug category confirms it in-game.
- [x] **Innervate-aware clock** — shipped in v0.5.2 via `Engine/ManaCooldowns.lua`, which
  now owns every mana source (Innervate, potions, Phase 2 class stubs) and the one value
  model the clock AND the advisor read. `inn 2:10` takes the secondary segment under 90s.
  [?] the "400% on the spirit share only" split, until the `regen` log around one Innervate.
- [x] **Overheal-calibrated HPM** — v0.5.3 (`Engine/Overheal.lua`): amount-weighted, per
  family and per rank, 150-event half-life, 40-event gate, persisted per character. An
  "Effective" toggle on the dashboard; the Pareto filter and suggested rank stay on raw
  values on purpose (`docs/DECISIONS.md` v0.5 §3).
- [x] **Persist fight history** — v0.5.3: last 20 in `MD.cdb.fights` with zone and heal
  totals; the pull-time seed prefers same-zone fights, which is the "last time here"
  reference.

### 1c. UX
- [x] **Per-row tooltips on the dashboard** — v0.5.4, via `RankMath:Explain()`; the header
  row hovers to a column glossary (which also fixed the hint paragraph wrapping onto the
  table).
- [x] **Simulate strip: Tree form toggle and Moonglow rank box** — v0.5.4, on a second
  row; costs fall back to the static table while either is overridden.
- [x] **One tooltip builder** — v0.5.0 (`UI/Tooltip.lua`); the widget gained a hover
  tooltip it never had.
- [x] **`/md profile`** — v0.5.4; opens the copy popup, shares `MD:Snapshot()` with
  `/md verify`.

### 1d. Housekeeping
- [x] Commit v0.4.6, remove the stale worktree.
- [x] Split `UI/Dashboard.lua` into `_Rows` (columns, pool, rendering) and `_Simulate`
  (the what-if strip) — v0.5.0.

## Phase 1.5 — from the first real dungeon log (v0.6)

`dungeon-BF-1.txt` (Blood Furnace, 28.8 min, 30 pulls) produced both a bug and a change of
emphasis: the author's mana problem is **waste, not running out** (38% overheal, 561 fully
wasted ticks, never below 36% mana except once). Design and architecture:
**`docs/DESIGN-v0.6.md`**; the calls are in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §v0.6.

- [x] **v0.6.0** HP5 **removed** (author: no new insight — it orders like HPM); the `OOM 0s`
  false alarm; digits gated on `sigma/net` (0.7, a slider, provenance in its tooltip);
  default view from usage; advisor names the richer cooldown it is holding.
- [x] **v0.6.1** `Engine/Targets.lua` (roster: class + role, read not inferred) and richer
  logs — snapshot on Copy, roster at each pull, shown-string changes, cooldown use.
- [x] **v0.6.2** `Engine/Calibration.lua` — the model checks itself against every heal
  landed, and reports drift. **Top priority:** stats, content and spec all change.
- [x] **v0.6.3** Waste view — overheal by spell / role / class / target, wasted mana, and
  the per-fight spend breakdown (~7% of mana is currently invisible).
- [x] **v0.6.4** Lifebloom rolling-vs-bloom economics; Life Tap detection.
- [x] **v0.6.5** `Engine/PullBudget.lua` — "2 more pulls, or 4 after a drink".
- [x] **v0.6.6** docs, TESTING §0b/§11–§14 for the new surface (`/md export` shipped in v0.6.1).
- [ ] **D2** Cell integration — investigation brief only (`docs/DESIGN-v0.6.md` §13).

**Caveat carried through all of it:** that log was a level 61 dungeon on a level 64 druid.
Heroics and raids differ. No constant from it is hard-coded.

## Phase 1.7 — fight recording, replay, coaching, simulation (v0.7)

Design `docs/DESIGN-v0.7.md`, debated (`docs/debates/v0.7-sim/`), decided (`docs/DECISIONS.md`
§v0.7), specified for implementation in **`docs/SPEC-v0.7.md`**. Order is fixed; each step is
one commit with its "verifiable by" line in the spec §0.

- [x] **v0.7.0** HP-at-cast + cost + form on every own cast; 20 s pre-pull ring; plan-free
  labels; summaries to 200 rows; the one-line "N of M casts on targets above 85%" summary.
  *(shipped; in-game check is TESTING §15)*
- [x] **v0.7.1** `RankMath:SpellKit`; `Engine/SimModel.lua`; `/md simrun` self-tests;
  `/md simreplay fixture` against `Data/SimFixture_BF1.lua`. *(shipped; ten self-tests and the
  fixture gate pass offline via `tools/run.sh tools/simcheck.lua`. The fixture exposed ~23
  mana/s of unreported energize — TESTING §16.)*
- [x] **v0.7.2** `Engine/FightRecorder.lua`; `/md export` recording section. *(shipped; verified
  end to end offline by `tools/run.sh tools/reccheck.lua`, 20 assertions.)*
- [x] **v0.7.3** HP half of replay; the six gates; `/md simreplay [n]`; Validate. *(shipped;
  the gates correctly reject the scripted pull in `tools/reccheck.lua`.)*
- [x] **v0.7.4** `Engine/SimPlanner.lua` rules + classifier; card; loop closure. *(shipped;
  `/md coach [n]`. The classifier's mana identity holds exactly in `tools/reccheck.lua`.)*
- [x] **v0.7.5** the search. *(shipped; coordinate descent, 4 seeds, <= 300 evaluations,
  sliced on `debugprofilestop`. Beats both baselines on the harness fight.)*
- [x] **v0.7.6** `UI/Dashboard_Review.lua` (Review tab) + the Fight recording settings pane.
  *(shipped; UI is in-game-only verification -- TESTING §20.)*
- [x] **v0.7.7** `UI/SimWindow.lua`, `Data/SimPresets.lua`, `FromRecordings`, Monte Carlo.
  *(shipped; the synthetic path is covered by `tools/run.sh tools/simwindow.lua`, the window
  itself only in-game -- TESTING §21.)*

## Phase 1.8 — replay visualisation (v0.8)

Two columns of unit frames on one clock — the fight as the healer played it, the fight as the
coached plan would have — both from the engine, the recorder's real HP snapshots drawn as
ticks. Spec: **`docs/SPEC-v0.8.md`**; the three calls are in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §v0.8.

- [x] **v0.8.0** the trace (`opts.trace` on `SM:Run`), `Engine/ReplayTrace.lua`, `SP.Replay`,
  `tools/replaycheck.lua`. *(shipped; 27 assertions offline, nothing to see in-game yet)*
- [x] **v0.8.1** `UI/ReplayWindow.lua` — frames, healer strip, damage pulses, cast flashes,
  snapshot ticks, scrubber; `/md replay [n]`; Play on the Review row. *(shipped; painted
  offline by `tools/replayui.lua`, the look itself is TESTING §23)*
- [x] **v0.8.2** HoT indicators; per-cast labels at the moment of the cast; the right column's
  waits. *(shipped; `tools/replayui.lua` sees the squares, the dot, the `early` label and the
  wait band; the look is TESTING §24)*
- [x] **v0.8.3** recorder: defensive cooldowns (whitelist) and debuffs on tracked targets;
  icons on the frames. *(shipped; every id in `Data/AuraList.lua` is VERIFY until seen in a
  recording — TESTING §25)*

### Phase 1.9 — the loop closes offline
- [x] **`tools/import.lua`** (2026-09-06): the game's SavedVariables as the addon's database;
  list / validate / replay / coach / export on real recordings without the game. First run on
  three solo fights measured the character's own unreported regen at ~31 mp5 (TESTING §16 A).

## Phase 1.10 — runs, the measured character, the drink (v0.9)

Spec: **`docs/SPEC-v0.9.md`**; the calls in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §v0.9.

- [x] **v0.9.0** measured mp5 (`cdb.mp5` from `/md regentest`) into `RM:Unreported()` and every
  recording's `initial.energize`; the profile snapshot; the import tool uses both. *(2026-09-06;
  an older recording gets the current measurement with `energizeAssumed` stated in the report.
  In-game: TESTING §27.)*
- [x] **v0.9.1** `Engine/RunRecorder.lua`: `/md run start|stop|status`, every pull plus the gaps
  (drinks, deaths, mana every 2 s), `cdb.runs`, auto-stop, `# run` export, `tools/runcheck.lua`.
  *(2026-09-06; the run's own drink rate is measured across the drink's interior. In-game:
  TESTING §28.)*
- [x] **v0.9.2** Review tab run selector; pulls of a run with every button; `import.lua runs`.
  *(2026-09-06; one address, `run:pull`, shared by the tab, `/md replay 2:7` and the tool's
  `--run K`. New suite `tools/reviewui.lua`. In-game: TESTING §29.)*
- [x] **v0.9.3** the run in the engine: `ChainRun`, the gap model with the run's own drink rate,
  `CoachRun`, the run card — "you drank 4x (3:10); this plan needs 2x (1:20)". *(2026-09-06;
  `/md coachrun N`, Coach run on the tab, `import.lua coach --run K`. Innervates in the gaps are
  counted, not modelled: the recording carries the total regen rate, not the spirit split.
  In-game: TESTING §30.)*
- [x] **v0.9.4** the run strip in the replay window; pull-by-pull Play through a dungeon.
  *(2026-09-06; `/md replay run N`, click a block to jump, the next pull follows on its own
  unless `db.replayNextPull` is off. In-game: TESTING §31.)*

## Phase 1.11 — the casts that are not heals (v0.10)

Spec: **`docs/SPEC-v0.10.md`**; the calls in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §v0.10.

- [x] **v0.10.1** `Data/DruidSpells.lua` (seeded from the TBC database, checked against recorded
  costs), `MD:ClassifyCast`, the learned `cdb.spellbook`, per-stream spell names, `import spells N`.
  *(2026-09-07; every cast in the author's fights is now named and classified.)*
- [x] **v0.10.2** fixed points: non-healing casts happen in the suggested column at the same time
  and cost; `spend coverage` counts what the engine reproduces, not what the healing kit prices.
  *(2026-09-07; two of the author's four recordings now pass every gate.)*
- [x] **v0.10.0** the deficit you still owe (health missing at the end priced as mana), the danger
  line measured from the fight's biggest hit instead of a flat 30%, and rule 4 casting the HoT
  whose whole heal fits the deficit. *(2026-09-07; shipped first because it is what the author
  kept seeing. Eating time in the run chain is still to do.)*
- [x] **v0.10.3** what the damage casts cost: their mana plus the regen lost to the five-second
  rule they restarted, measured as the difference between two runs.
- [x] **v0.10.4** several strategies from one search (safest / highest health / least mana / most
  regen), shown as rows and selectable for the replay's suggested column. *(2026-09-07;
  `/md coach N safe|health|cheap|regen`. The replay window's selector is still to do.)*

## Phase 1.12 — one window, four groups (v0.11)

Spec: **`docs/SPEC-v0.11.md`**. The author's ask on 2026-09-07: merge the settings and dashboard
windows, keep the settings palette, and group the views the way ElvUI does — level 1 vertical on
the left, level 2 horizontal on top, deeper levels in a box that repeats the rule.

- [x] **v0.11.0** `UI.PALETTE`, `UI.CreateNavFrame` / `UI.CreateNavBox`, `tools/navui.lua`.
  *(2026-09-07; the kit only. No window has moved yet, so nothing changed on screen.)*
- [x] **v0.11.1** the dashboard moves in: Spells and Reports. *(2026-09-07; new suite
  `tools/dashui.lua`, the dashboard's first offline test.)*
- [x] **v0.11.2** Settings becomes the fourth group; `UI/OptionsFrame.lua` becomes a shim.
  *(2026-09-07; 114 lines to 50, and a fourth bare pipe found in the command list.)*
- [x] **v0.11.3** Simulate becomes the third group; the standalone window goes.
- [x] **v0.11.4** Runs as its own Reports view, appearing once a run exists. *(2026-09-07; the
  level-3 box is built and tested but still has no user — nothing needed it yet, which is the
  right reason not to use it.)*

## Phase 1.13 — what the healer can see (v0.12)

Spec: **`docs/SPEC-v0.12.md`**. The plan may know what the author's own unit frames tell them and
nothing else; their Cell layout is the specification, read on 2026-09-07. Exactly two of their
enabled indicators are foresight: **aggro** and **an enemy cast with a named target**.

- [x] **v0.12.0** record threat and enemy casts (`K.THREAT`, `K.ECAST`), `db.recordThreat`.
  *(2026-09-07; a cast is paired with the damage it did, because the log's SPELL_CAST_START
  carries no destination. A cast that never landed stays in the record with no landing time.)*
- [x] **v0.12.1** `Plan:Decide` reads them: a cast in the air counts towards rule 4's room, and
  `Anchor` prefers a target that has threat. *(2026-09-07; the line is tested — a cast bar at 38 s
  may move the heal before the hit, a swing at 40 s may not.)*
- [x] **v0.12.2** the replay draws the Targeted Spells icon and the aggro bar, in the author's own
  positions, on both columns. *(2026-09-07.)*
- [x] **v0.12.3** why it cast that, there, then: a reason record from `Plan:Decide` with the
  numbers that made the rule fire, the same treatment for the classifier's labels on the recorded
  casts, rendered in the replay, on the card and in the import tool. *(2026-09-07; the reason is
  the rule's own inputs read back, and `replaycheck` asserts field by field that it cites nothing
  `Decide` was not given. It found a real bug on the way: `math.max(a, SM.SeenDamage(...))` takes
  BOTH of SeenDamage's returns, so the wait sentence was printing the biggest single hit as a
  rate.)*

## Phase 1.14 — the solver (v0.13)

Spec: **`docs/SPEC-v0.13.md`**. A spell is a series of deposits; the cast to make is the
one that removes the most missing-health-seconds per mana, against a forecast that may
read only what a human can see.

- [x] **v0.13.0** `Engine/SimSolver.lua`: deposits, the causal forecast, the gap integral,
  the value comparison, waiting as a priced candidate, and the danger-line override.
  `tools/solvercheck.lua` (17 assertions) and `tools/solvercmp.lua` (the control
  experiment). *(2026-09-08; 33% less mana than the threshold rules for identical deaths
  and floor seconds, on the author's five recordings.)*
- [x] **v0.13.1** healer intuition: a prior on incoming damage per zone and role, learned
  from OTHER recordings and never from the fight being planned (leave-one-out enforced in
  the signature and asserted in the harness). *(2026-09-08; it learns the right thing —
  TANK 1463/s at the pull over ten ranked Nightbane logs — and pre-casts before the first
  hit, but ships OFF: it has not been shown to help, and cannot be until v0.13.3.)*
- [x] **v0.13.2** deformed foresight of the current fight (`Engine/Foresight.lua`), the
  solver's explainer (rules 7-9 name the number they decided on), and `SP.STRATEGY_SET` —
  three forecasts (none / old-log prior / blurred foresight) plus two rule configs and two
  solver dials, all runnable side by side by `tools/strategies.lua`. *(2026-09-08; the
  blind solver still wins on the author's corpus, so both forecasts ship selectable and
  neither is default.)*
- [x] **v0.13.3** four forecasts, selectable: none / your own past records / a prior merged
  from 22 logged fights across 13 encounters (`Data/Intuition_TBC.lua`, generated by
  `tools/buildintuition.lua`) / blurred foresight of this fight. Priors are stored as
  fractions of max health so they transfer between characters and content.
  *(2026-09-09; the corpus prior is inert on the author's solo recordings -- correctly, a
  raid corpus has learned that healers take nothing at the pull -- and the blind solver is
  still the default.)*
- [x] **v0.13.4** the wait rule judged casting now and waiting over DIFFERENT windows, so
  the solver deferred almost indefinitely under sustained damage. Found by ranking the
  strategies on a held-out Warcraft Logs fight: the human cast 82 times, the solver 26.
  *(2026-09-09; casts 26 -> 52 on that fight, deaths 2 -> 1; the author's-recordings
  headline drops from 43% to 33% because part of the old saving was under-casting.)*
- [x] **v0.13.5** the control row: every strategy table now leads with the recorded casts
  through the same engine, because a planner's deaths cannot be told from the simulation's
  without it. Plus `sag` (convex deficit weighting -- measured inert, ships at 0) and
  `AtRisk` treating being under the danger line as a fact rather than a forecast.
  *(2026-09-09; the control showed the raid fight's death belongs to the engine, which
  retracts v0.13.4's "the rules edge the solver on raids".)*
## Phase 1.15 — v0.14.x: make the replay tell the truth

The numbering below replaces the leftovers from earlier renames. Ordered by what unblocks
what: nothing above the engine is worth tuning while the engine heals half as much as the
log says it did.

- [x] **v0.14.2 — two HoT bugs.** *(2026-09-10.)* (a) Lifebloom's bloom did not scale with its stacks. `Land(a, st.bloom, ...)`
  in `SimModel`'s expiry, where the ticks beside it are `st.tick * st.stacks`. Rolling
  Lifebloom therefore under-heals by up to 2x the bloom, and Lifebloom is 70% of a resto
  druid's healing. Measured: one cast reproduces exactly (ratio 1.00), two 0.82, four rolling
  **0.55**. `SV.Deposits` already assumed the bloom scales, so the solver was planning for
  healing the engine never delivered. (b) **A refresh restarted the tick timer.** TBC's
  periodic effect keeps its own cadence across a refresh; ours re-anchored `nextTick`, so a
  Lifebloom rolled every 1.5s against a 1s tick fired two ticks in three. Together they take
  the author's own recordings from 47/52/70/42% of the recorded healing to **58/66/74/48%**.
  Not closed: ticks are still 255 of the log's 366 on a raid parse, and the rest is
  `v0.14.4`.
- [x] **v0.14.3 — the bloom is a second spell id.** *(2026-09-10; `SD.alias` + `SD:Resolve`, used at every heal-attribution site. Not a row in `SD.spells`, which would corrupt the known-rank index.)* 33778 is Lifebloom's bloom and 33763 the
  HoT; `Data/SpellData.lua` knows only 33763, so **44,946 healing on one parse is attributed
  to nothing at all**. Needs an alias rather than a second rank-1 row, which would corrupt
  the known-rank index.
- [x] **v0.14.4 — the rest of the reproduction gap.** *(2026-09-11; `docs/SPEC-v0.14.md` §4b.)*
  47% -> **95%** on the Malchezaar parse, phantom death gone, 358 of 366 ticks. Three findings,
  only one of them in the engine:
  (a) the missing healing was **one target** -- every other player reproduced 100% of their
  heal events, and 111 of the 124 missing ones were simply downstream of the tank dying at
  53.2s, since `Land` refuses a corpse. The v0.14.2 note's guess (8 of 10 players tracked) was
  wrong: the roster is 8 and all 8 are tracked.
  (b) `wclrules.py --observed` assumed the **median** Lifebloom tick was a 3-stack one; in that
  parse the ticks are 264/528/792 and the median is a 2-stack tick, so every calibrated tick was
  two thirds of the truth. Now measured from the bottom cluster. Also: the bloom row is keyed
  33778 and the kit 33763, so it had never matched anything -- `SD:Resolve` at both consumers.
  (c) **v0.14.2's bloom-scales-with-stacks was wrong and is reverted.** Pairing every bloom in
  the corpus with the tick before it gives the same bloom at 1, 2 and 3 stacks (Nightbane #55:
  231/462/694 tick -> 1501 bloom, all three). The 2.1x spread that suggested scaling was a crit
  (exactly 1.5x) and a +healing proc (exactly 1.30x, and the same 1.30 is on Regrowth's and
  Rejuvenation's ticks in the same fight). Self-test 4b now measures the bloom directly by
  running the chain twice with the bloom zeroed, and fails against the unfixed engine.
  Consequence: the solver's margin over the rules re-measures at **44% less mana**, not 33%.
- [ ] **v0.14.5 — one set of frames for the whole run.** Playback no longer stops at a pull
  boundary (v0.14.1) but `RunSeek` reaches the next pull through `OpenReplay`, which re-lays
  the window out. Needs rows built once from `RT.Roster` with each pull's roster mapped on by
  name; `PaintFrame` is 190 lines bound to the trace and the scenario's target table. Carries
  the run strip as the scrubber's cursor and the in-place strategy redraw
  (`RebuildSuggested` still calls `OpenReplay`).
- [ ] **v0.14.6 — the solver's reasons in the replay and on the card.** It decided on a
  number; the sentence can name it. `SV.ReasonText` exists and is wired into `SP.ReasonText`,
  but the card's `why` section and the strip still assume a rules plan.
- [x] **v0.14.7 — the heal values were right; two readers of them were not.**
  (a) **`Engine/FightRecorder.lua` wrote every own heal down twice over** -- the multi-return
  trap `CLAUDE.md` names, third occurrence: `local _, gross = MD.Overheal and
  MD.Overheal:Split(...)` truncates to one value, so `gross` was always nil and the fallback
  `amount + overheal` always ran. This client reports `amount` GROSS, so every recording ever
  made carries heal + overheal -- 1.0x the truth where nothing was wasted, 2.0x where
  everything was. That is the whole of the "uncalibrated 46-68%". The overheal was never
  stored separately, so v1 streams cannot be un-mixed; the stream now carries `v = 2` and
  `tools/reproduce.lua` / `tools/healcheck.lua` say so rather than quoting a magnitude.
  (b) **`tools/wclconvert.py` read the log's `spellPower` as +healing.** In a TBC log that is
  SPELL DAMAGE; healing gear is itemised at about +88 healing per +31 damage, so every
  imported raid healer ran at a third of their power. `SPELLPOWER_TO_HEALING = 3.08`,
  measured: `tools/wclcheckkit.lua --fit` solves each parse for the +healing that reproduces
  the log one row at a time, and four independent families agree per parse to within a few
  percent (Ghnoy: 2000 / 2040 / 2045 / 2105). Over 17 parses, implied/spellPower is min 2.66,
  median 3.08, max 3.46.
  (c) **Nothing in `Data/SpellData.lua`'s heal values changed.** They were checked and they
  hold; the `-- VERIFY` marks come off Rejuvenation R13 and Regrowth R10. Tranquility's heal
  ids are aliased (26983 -> 44208, 9863 -> 44207, both measured by pairing caster with healer
  in the corpus), so 43,104 healing stops landing in family `?`.
  (d) **Result:** the Malchezaar control reproduces **95% with no calibration at all** (the
  observed table is now worth one point, 95 -> 96); `wclcheckkit` reads 0.93-0.97 where it
  read 1.46-1.82. New tool `tools/healcheck.lua` -- the client-side twin of `wclcheckkit`,
  the author's own profile against their own recordings, read by the minimum of each bucket.

- [ ] **v0.14.8 — `SP.Search` over the solver's parameters** (`minValue`, `horizon`), the four
  strategy objectives reading the solver's pool, and the Review tab able to say which planner
  coached a fight.

- [x] **v0.14.9 — heal values on the game's spell tooltips** (the author's request, after
  Dynamic Tooltip). The dashboard compares ranks; a tooltip answers "what does this button
  do". `UI/SpellTooltip.lua` hooks the game's tooltip and appends `MD.Tip:Spell`: Rejuvenation's
  tick x4 and total; Regrowth's direct range, crit range, tick x7, HoT total and whole cast;
  Lifebloom's tick at 1/2/3 stacks, HoT total, bloom, total and rolled-at-3 value; Healing
  Touch's range; what Swiftmend eats; downrank and measured-overheal lines; Shift for the
  derivation. Same RankMath row as the dashboard, live context only. `tools/spelltip.lua`
  asserts every number against the simulator's own SpellKit and the dashboard's heal.

- [x] **v0.15.0 — Practice: heal a fight you play** (the author's request, `docs/SPEC-v0.15.md`).
  Set up a group and its damage, heal it yourself in real time by hovering frames and pressing
  your own bindings (defaults: your Cell click-casting), and get it back as a recording that
  replays, validates and coaches like a dungeon pull. One engine: SimModel's loop in a
  coroutine paced to the wall clock, so the replay reproduces what was played exactly. Open for
  a later version: rolled crits, cancelling a cast, Innervate / potions / Tranquility, enemy
  cast bars and aggro in the generated fight, other healers that react to you.

- [x] **v0.15.1 — the practice bindings window, and importing Cell / Clique** (the author's
  request). `/md binds` (or Edit bindings on the panel): a row per binding in the shape Cell's
  Click Castings and Clique use, and two import buttons. Cell's attribute keys are decoded the
  way Cell encodes them and a macro binding resolves to the first heal the macro casts, rank
  included; Clique's keys are already the client's spelling. What cannot be imported is listed
  by name rather than guessed. Neither addon is a dependency or read during a fight.

- [x] **v0.15.2 — the spell picker is a tree, and the game's own keybindings import.**
  A flat list of forty ranks ran off the bottom of the bindings window, so `UI.CreateTreeDropdown`
  puts a family's ranks in a submenu on hover. And the import the author actually needs: their
  healing is mouseover MACROS on action bars, which neither Cell nor Clique knows about, so
  `PR.ImportKeybinds` walks every binding, follows it to its action-bar slot (Blizzard's page
  offsets, or any bar button's `action` attribute -- ElvUI, Bartender, Dominos) and reads the
  spell or the macro's first heal. A binding that casts on the target rather than the mouseover
  is imported with a note saying so.

- [x] **v0.15.3 — damage spells on the tooltip** (the author's request). Wrath, Starfire,
  Moonfire, Insect Swarm, Hurricane: hit and crit range, DoT ticks, totals, DPM / DPS at this
  character's spell damage. The base damage is read from the game's own tooltip (TBC's are
  static), because no damage table has been verified and none may be typed from memory; the
  coefficients reuse the heal rules (the hybrid split reproduces Moonfire's 0.15 / 0.52), and
  the tick periods and Balance talents are VERIFY until a hit on a dummy confirms them. Feral
  abilities are out: they scale with weapon and attack power, not spell damage.

Known and deliberately not fixed:

- **Regrowth's DIRECT reads about 13% low** against the whole Warcraft Logs corpus: on every
  parse that has the row it asks for ~28% more +healing than the other four families
  (`tools/wclcheckkit.lua --fit`). The coefficient is the community's own amount-weighted
  hybrid split (0.287 / 0.699, `docs/DECISIONS.md` v0.6 §15) and the HoT half of that same
  split agrees with Rejuvenation and Lifebloom to within 5%, so it is not simply
  mis-weighted. A measurement without a mechanism is not a licence to edit frozen data.

- The **bottom-cluster** heuristic for a 1-stack Lifebloom tick fails on 6 of the 17 parses
  (implying +745 to +1280 of healing where the parse's other rows agree on ~+2100). Same
  corpus question as the per-stack spread below.

- One druid's **per-stack** Lifebloom tick moves between applications inside a single
  Nightbane parse -- 115, 231, 244, 260, 308, 345 -- and changes on a refresh, which is
  Lifebloom re-snapshotting (a proc falling off drops a rolling 3-stack from 781 to 694
  mid-chain). A single median cannot calibrate that, which is why those two parses still
  reproduce 64% and 40%. A 2.7x spread is more than any proc explains; it is an open question
  about the corpus, not about the engine, and it is why the Malchezaar parse (one flat base,
  264) is the control to quote.

- `sag` (the convex deficit weighting, v0.13.5) is **measured inert** and ships at 0. It stays
  because it encodes a stated preference, not because it has been shown to help.
- Runs recorded before v0.13.7 have no gap health; a continuous replay of one holds the last
  pull's bars. That is data, not code.
- "Rules: HoTs only" scores identically to "Rules: balanced" on the author's fights. Believed
  to be because nobody drops below the 45% direct-heal line there, so rule 2 never fires --
  worth confirming on a harder fight before trusting that row.

## Phase 2 — other classes (after 1 is green)

Generic parts already work for any mana class: the OOM clock, widget, datatexts,
regen model (except class-specific unreported regen), spend tracker (live costs),
fight summary, drink reminder. Class-specific: the rank dashboard, the advisor's
Innervate branch, unreported regen talents.

- [ ] **Data**: per-class spell tables (Priest first: Lesser/Greater Heal, Flash Heal,
  Renew, PoM, PoH, CoH; then Paladin, Shaman). Heal values marked VERIFY until someone
  with the class runs `/md verify`.
- [ ] **RankMath**: class table of coefficient rules (direct / HoT / hybrid / channel),
  talent multipliers per class, in-5SR talent per class (Meditation etc. — the
  `IN_FSR_TALENT` table in `RegenModel` already has Priest/Mage).
- [ ] **Unreported regen**: Shaman Unrelenting Storm and any int-based mp5 talent —
  only after someone runs `/md regentest` on that class.
- [~] **Advisor**: done structurally in v0.5.2 — `Engine/ManaCooldowns.lua` owns the
  per-class table (Shadowfiend / Mana Tide / Divine Illumination are present as stubs) and
  the generic potion branch, and both the advisor and the clock read it. Each stub still
  needs a value model plus one in-game log from someone of that class.
- [ ] **Testing without alts**: `/md verify`, `/md regentest`, `/md spamtest` and the
  debug console Copy are the hand-off — ask a guildmate of that class for three pastes.
