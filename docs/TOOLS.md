# tools/ — the offline harness

Everything here runs the **real addon files** against a fake WoW client
(`tools/wowstub.lua`), so it catches ordering and arithmetic bugs a syntax check cannot.
Nothing in `tools/` ships: `release.sh` builds from the `.toc`'s own file list.

```bash
bash tools/run.sh tools/<script>.lua [args]
```

`run.sh` builds a real Lua 5.1.5 into `tools/.lua` on first use (gitignored), then runs the
script against this checkout. **It passes the checkout root as `arg[1]`**, so a script's own
arguments start at `arg[2]` — the older tools survive reading from `arg[1]` only because
their parsers happen to reject a path.

Python tools run directly with `python3` and need no harness.

## 1. The test suites

Run all of them before committing anything the engine, the recorder or a tooltip touches.

| suite | what it holds down |
|---|---|
| `simcheck.lua` | the engine's ten self-tests + the BF-1 fixture replay (`--curve` prints the mana curve beside the log's) |
| `reccheck.lua` | a whole scripted pull through the real combat-log handler: the stream, the labels, the summary row |
| `replaycheck.lua` | the trace and the replay state machine; *seek == step*; **the causality invariant** |
| `replayui.lua` | the replay window painted under the stub — the nil-index / argument-order / bare-pipe class of bug |
| `runcheck.lua` | a whole scripted dungeon: pulls, gaps, a drink at a known rate, a death, the budget, auto-stop |
| `reviewui.lua` | the Review tab: rows, buttons, and the `run:pull` address across tab, commands and replay |
| `navui.lua` | the navigation kit: lazy panes, one pane at a time, the remembered path |
| `dashui.lua` | the one window, driven the way a mouse would |
| `regencheck.lua` | `/md regentest` against a scripted mana stream, and **what it stores** |
| `simwindow.lua` | every preset combination's scenario, baselines and search |
| `solvercheck.lua` | the solver: deposits, the gap integral, causality, the four forecasts, the explainer |
| `timeline.lua` | the run's clock: segments, seeks, health across a gap |
| `practice.lua` | a practice session played against a fake clock: the seeded damage, the game's rules, the live trace, and **the recording replaying to exactly what was played** |
| `practiceui.lua` | practice from the screen: panel, Start, presses on frames and keys over them, pause, End, the replay, Review's Practice list |
| `spelltip.lua` | the spell tooltip (v0.14.9): druid only, once per showing, off means off, and **every number on it is the model's own** — the tick and bloom the simulator heals with, the dashboard's heal |
| `migrate.lua` | the rename (2026-09-27): a ManaDemon WTF comes up as SpellTuner's with every setting, recording and practice fight; `/md` still answers |
| `probecheck.lua` | **the Forever probe** (T0) under the stub's `forever` profile: never raises, a missing function is "absent" not an error, a secret is "secret" not a sum, a bad event is caught, the report is ASCII with no bare pipe and keyed by build, the sections are in order, the description dump is whole, the TOC that loaded is named; since **T0c** also a blocked action recorded with what the probe was doing, the combat log registered only by `/st probe clog`, the secret readings and restriction state, Q1 by bonus damage or level with was/now lines, Q6 at level 10, and the release carrying exactly three TOCs |

```bash
for t in simcheck reccheck replaycheck replayui runcheck reviewui navui dashui \
         regencheck simwindow solvercheck timeline spelltip practice practiceui \
         migrate probecheck; do
  printf "%-13s " "$t"; bash tools/run.sh tools/$t.lua 2>&1 | tail -1
done
```

## 2. Working with real recordings

### `import.lua` — your own fights, offline

Loads the game's SavedVariables as the addon's database and runs the same engine the Review
tab runs, without the game.

```bash
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua list                 # every recording + its verdict
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua validate 1           # the eight gates, in full
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua replay 1             # every cast, its label and its reason
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua coach 1 force        # the search and the card
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua spells 1             # where the mana went, by kind
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua export 1             # -> .logs/recordings/<id>.txt
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua runs                 # stored runs
bash tools/run.sh tools/import.lua validate 3 --run 1   # run 1, pull 3 (the "1:3" address)
```

Options: `--file <path>` (default `$MD_SAVEDVARS`, then `.logs/SpellTuner.lua`, then the
author's install), `--char "Name-Realm"`, `--run K`.

### `reproduce.lua` — does the engine reproduce the recording at all?

```bash
bash tools/run.sh tools/reproduce.lua .logs/wcl-holdout.lua .logs/wcl-holdout-observed.lua
```

Replays a recording's own casts and reports how much of the **recorded healing** the engine
generates from them, split per family and per heal event, with the cast count and the deaths
beside it. Run this before believing any comparison.

With an `observed.lua` the kit is first scaled to what the log says each spell healed, so
spell values are removed from the question and what is left is the engine alone.

Since **v0.14.7** the Malchezaar control reads **95% with no calibration at all**, and the
observed table is worth one point on top of that (95 -> 96) — which is what it should be
worth once the spell data is right. Per family, uncalibrated: Lifebloom 90%, Regrowth 87%,
Rejuvenation 103%, Swiftmend 67%. The old "uncalibrated 46-68%" was not the spell data: the
recorder was writing every own heal down as heal + overheal, so the **log** column was
inflated, not the engine column. A stream recorded before v0.14.7 (`v = 1`) is flagged in the
output and its share is not a statement about the engine. See `docs/SPEC-v0.14.md` §4b, §4c.

The `observed.lua` beside it is written by `wclrules.py --observed`:

```bash
python3 tools/wclrules.py .logs/wcl/waFx9B1kNQJWP3hq-103.json \
        --healer Samwellx --observed .logs/wcl-holdout-observed.lua
```

### `healcheck.lua` — this character's own heals against the model

```bash
bash tools/run.sh tools/healcheck.lua            # finds the SavedVariables the way import.lua does
bash tools/run.sh tools/healcheck.lua .logs/SpellTuner.lua
```

The client-side twin of `wclcheckkit.lua`: every own heal event in every recording, bucketed
by spell and kind, against what the model says that spell heals — with the **profile the
client itself wrote down**, so it is the one fully trusted calibration in the project.

Read it by the **minimum** column. A recorded amount is gross, so a bucket should be one
value; anything above its own minimum is overheal that should not be there. That is how
v0.14.7's recorder bug was found, and it is how the author confirms the fix: on the next
dungeon every bucket should sit on the model and stop running to twice it.

Lifebloom's tick is per-stack, so its bucket is three overlapping ones (1x / 2x / 3x a base);
the 1-stack cluster is printed separately.

### `solvercmp.lua` — the solver against the threshold rules

```bash
bash tools/run.sh tools/solvercmp.lua
bash tools/run.sh tools/solvercmp.lua --file .logs/wcl-all.lua
```

Sweeps `minValue` / `horizon` and prints the frontier against the rules baseline.

### `strategies.lua` — every strategy side by side

```bash
bash tools/run.sh tools/strategies.lua
bash tools/run.sh tools/strategies.lua --file .logs/wcl-all.lua --char "Blohz-Nightslayer"
```

Runs all of `SP.STRATEGY_SET` over every recording, on the same lexicographic tuple, and
marks which ones are causal. **This is the table to look at when choosing a strategy.**

## 3. Warcraft Logs

Credentials live in `.logs/wcl.json` (gitignored); the bearer token is cached in
`.logs/wcl.token` and refreshed automatically.

```bash
# 1. download one fight's raw event streams -> .logs/wcl/<report>-<fight>.json
python3 tools/wclfetch.py bdByCxDv6rVQhRMf 145

# 2. turn raw fights into SpellTuner recordings
python3 tools/wclconvert.py .logs/wcl/bdByCxDv6rVQhRMf-145.json --healer Blohz \
                            .logs/wcl/L8NJymzZW9RKtdYQ-27.json  --healer Ghnoy \
                            --out .logs/wcl-records.lua
```

**v0.14.7:** the `spellPower` a TBC log carries is the character sheet's **spell damage**, not
+healing, and the converter now scales it by `SPELLPOWER_TO_HEALING = 3.08` (measured by
`wclcheckkit.lua --fit` over 17 parses: min 2.66, median 3.08, max 3.46). Regenerate any
corpus converted before v0.14.7 — the healers in it are running at a third of their power.

`wclconvert.py` writes **two** files: `<out>.lua` (a SavedVariables-shaped database for the
offline tools) and `<out>-append.lua` (a block to paste at the end of the game's
`SpellTuner.lua` with the client closed, to replay the fights in-game — deleting the block is
the whole undo).

```bash
# 3. what the healer did, and the state of the fight when they did it
python3 tools/wclrules.py .logs/wcl/bdByCxDv6rVQhRMf-145.json --healer Blohz

# 4. what our model says a spell heals, against what the log says it DID
bash tools/run.sh tools/wclcheckkit.lua
#    ...and the other direction: solve each parse for the +healing that reproduces
#    it, one row at a time. Four families agreeing is what verifies Data/SpellData.lua.
bash tools/run.sh tools/wclcheckkit.lua .logs/wcl-records.lua .logs/wcl-observed.lua --fit

# 5. merge many imported fights into the shipped prior
bash tools/run.sh tools/buildintuition.lua .logs/wcl-all.lua
#    -> Data/Intuition_TBC.lua   (GENERATED - do not hand edit)
```

### What is on disk now

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `.logs/wcl/*.json` | 22 raw fights, kept so a conversion bug can be re-run without spending API points |
| `.logs/wcl-all.lua` | all 22 imported fights, 13 encounters — the corpus |
| `.logs/wcl-records.lua` | the two Nightbane parses (rank #1 and #50) |
| `.logs/wcl-*-append.lua` | the in-game paste blocks for each of the above |
| `Data/Intuition_TBC.lua` | the shipped prior built from `wcl-all.lua` |

**Two traps the converter documents, because both are silent:** `classResources`' key names
lie (`amount` is max mana, `type` is current mana, `max` is the cast's cost), and player
health is reported as a **percentage** — max HP is recovered by least squares against the
absolute damage and healing.

## 4. Not a tool

`harness.lua` (loads the addon files and returns `MD`), `wowstub.lua` (the fake client) and
`fakepull.lua` (the shared scripted pull) are machinery the suites use. Keep
`harness.lua`'s file list in step with `SpellTuner_TBC.toc`. `wowstub.lua` has two profiles:
`tbc` (the default, what every suite above runs under) and `forever` (what `probecheck.lua`
selects: no combat log, `issecretvalue`, a secret stand-in whose arithmetic raises, `C_Spell` /
`C_SpellBook`, a Forever build string).
